# Snowball for OpenCode

Complete guide for using Snowball with [OpenCode.ai](https://opencode.ai).

## Installation

Add snowball to the `plugin` array in your `opencode.json` (global or project-level):

```json
{
  "plugin": ["snowball@git+https://github.com/kellenff/snowball.git"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode. The plugin installs through OpenCode's plugin manager and
registers all skills.

Verify by asking: "Tell me about your snowball"

OpenCode uses its own plugin install. If you also use Claude Code, Codex, or
another harness, install Snowball separately for each one.

### Migrating from the old symlink-based install

If you previously installed snowball using `git clone` and symlinks, remove the old setup:

```bash
# Remove old symlinks
rm -f ~/.config/opencode/plugins/snowball.js
rm -rf ~/.config/opencode/skills/snowball

# Optionally remove the cloned repo
rm -rf ~/.config/opencode/snowball

# Remove skills.paths from opencode.json if you added one for snowball
```

Then follow the installation steps above.

## Usage

### Finding Skills

Use OpenCode's native `skill` tool to list all available skills:

```text
use skill tool to list skills
```

### Loading a Skill

```text
use skill tool to load snowball/brainstorming
```

### Personal Skills

Create your own skills in `~/.config/opencode/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/my-skill
```

Create `~/.config/opencode/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Use when [condition] - [what it does]
---

# My Skill

[Your skill content here]
```

### Project Skills

Create project-specific skills in `.opencode/skills/` within your project.

**Skill Priority:** Project skills > Personal skills > Snowball skills

## Updating

OpenCode installs Snowball through a git-backed package spec. Some OpenCode
and Bun versions pin that resolved git dependency in a lockfile or cache, so a
restart may not pick up the newest Snowball commit. If updates do not appear,
clear OpenCode's package cache or reinstall the plugin.

To pin a specific version, use a branch or tag:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["snowball@git+https://github.com/kellenff/snowball.git#v5.0.3"]
}
```

## How It Works

The plugin wires OpenCode's lifecycle hooks to the same snowball features that
run on Claude Code and Cursor:

1. **Injects bootstrap context** via the `experimental.chat.messages.transform`
   hook, adding snowball awareness to every conversation.
2. **Registers the skills directory** via the `config` hook, so OpenCode
   discovers all snowball skills without symlinks or manual config.
3. **Captures decisions and blast-radius audits** on lifecycle events:
   - `chat.message` — when you submit an approval phrase (e.g. "lgtm", "ship
     it"), records a decision MADR and a blast-radius operator-approval audit.
   - `event: session.idle` — at the end of each turn, records a blast-radius
     stop audit and runs implicit decision extraction.
   - `experimental.session.compacting` — extracts decisions before context is
     compacted.

   Captures land in `docs/snowball/decisions/` and never block the chat path —
   if anything fails they no-op silently.

### Decision extraction requires the `claude` CLI

Implicit extraction (on idle and before compaction) shells out to the `claude`
CLI to do the LLM extraction, the same engine Claude Code and Cursor use. If
`claude` (or a `SNOWBALL_CLAUDE_BIN` override) is not on your `PATH`, extraction
**no-ops silently** — approval-phrase capture and blast-radius audits still work.

### AskUserQuestion capture is not available on OpenCode

Claude Code and Cursor capture explicit multiple-choice answers
(`AskUserQuestion` / `AskQuestion`). OpenCode has no equivalent labeled
question tool, so per-question decision capture is not wired here. This will be
revisited if OpenCode adds a multiple-choice question mechanism.

### Tool Mapping

Skills written for Claude Code are automatically adapted for OpenCode:

- `TodoWrite` → `todowrite`
- `Task` with subagents → OpenCode's `@mention` system
- `Skill` tool → OpenCode's native `skill` tool
- File operations → Native OpenCode tools

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not loading

1. Check OpenCode logs: `opencode run --print-logs "hello" 2>&1 | grep -i snowball`
2. Verify the plugin line in your `opencode.json` is correct
3. Make sure you're running a recent version of OpenCode

### Windows install issues

Some Windows OpenCode builds have upstream installer issues with git-backed
plugin specs, including cache paths for `git+https` URLs and Bun not finding
`git.exe` even when it works in a normal terminal. If OpenCode cannot install
the plugin, try installing with system npm and pointing OpenCode at the local
package:

```powershell
npm install snowball@git+https://github.com/kellenff/snowball.git --prefix "$HOME\.config\opencode"
```

Then use the installed package path in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["~/.config/opencode/node_modules/snowball"]
}
```

### Skills not found

1. Use OpenCode's `skill` tool to list available skills
2. Check that the plugin is loading (see above)
3. Each skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with valid YAML frontmatter

### Bootstrap not appearing

1. Check OpenCode version supports the `experimental.chat.messages.transform` hook
2. Restart OpenCode after config changes
